###
hEcho receives an hCommand and responds with a result
with the same <params> that were in the hCommand.
###
status = require("./../codes").hResultStatus
hEcho = ->


  ###
  Method executed each time an hCommand with cmd = 'hEcho' is received.
  Once the execution finishes we should call the callback.
  @param hMessage - hMessage with hCommand received with cmd = 'hEcho'
  @param context - Auxiliary functions,attrs from the controller.
  @param cb(status, result) - function that receives arg:
  status: //Constant from var status to indicate the result of the hCommand
  result: //An optional result object defined by the hCommand
  ###
hEcho::exec = (hMessage, context, cb) ->
  hcommand = hMessage.payload

  #For test purpose
  if hcommand.params.error is "DIV0"
    div = "12 / 0"
    div.push div
  cb status.OK, hcommand.params


###
Expose hEcho
###
exports.Command = hEcho
