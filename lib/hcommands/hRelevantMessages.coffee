  ###
  Method executed each time an hCommand with cmd = 'hRelevantMessages' is received.
  Once the execution finishes we should call the callback.
  @param hMessage - hMessage received with hCommand with cmd = 'hRelevantMessages'
  @param context - Auxiliary functions,attrs from the controller.
  @param cb(status, result) - function that receives arg:
  status: //Constant from var status to indicate the result of the hCommand
  result: //Array of relevant hMessages
